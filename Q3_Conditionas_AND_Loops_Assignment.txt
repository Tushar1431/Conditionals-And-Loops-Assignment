*LOOPS* :-

A loop in programming is the repetitive execution of a set of instructions until a specified condition is met. 
It is used to automate repeated tasks and simplify code. In programming, a loop is a term used to describe the
process of manually retyping codes that need to be repeated.


#NEED :-
To Minimize the repetative task , to reduce the manule work we use concept of loops.
Loops are handy, if we want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

#Different Kinds of Loops :-

1)for :- loops through a block of code a number of times.
Example:
 
 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
 { 
	console.log("Hello World!"); 
}

2)for/in :- loops through the properties of an object.

Example:-

let myObj = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }; 
for (let key in myObj) 
{ 
	console.log(key, myObj[key]); 
}


3)for/of  :- loops through the values of an iterable object.
Syntax:-

for(let variable_name of  object_name) {
    // Statement
}

Example:-

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
for (let value of arr) 
{ 
	console.log(value); 
}


4)while :- loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
Example:-

// JavaScript code to use while loop 
let val = 1; 

while (val < 6) { 
	console.log(val); 
	val += 1; 
}

5) do while:- This loop atleast executes one in his cycle .
Example:-

let test = 1; 

do { 
	console.log(test); 
	test++; 
} while(test <= 5)
